what is function ?  :   fucntion is a block of code that code can be used again again

        using function we can reduce our work

why we use function ? 

        using of fucntion can reduce our code and it sve time so, devlopment becane easier and faster

when we use function ?

        wehn we want to devlop complex project at that time we divide code in different diffferent section in the form of function 

how to use function ?

    to use function in python we have to use inbuilt keywords - different

    using of def keyword we can define fuction.

    e.g., def funname()
                statement


--------------------------------------------------------------------

types of fucntions

there are mainly 2 type of functions 

1) built - in function : print() , len() , input()

2) user defined fuction : which is defined by user



========================================================================

fucntion categories : 

there is 4 type of categories

1) fucntion without parameteres and fucntion without return type.
2) fucntion with parameteres and fucntion without return type.
3) fucntion without parameteres and fucntion with return type.
4) fucntion with parameteres and fucntion with return type.


1) fucntion without parameteres and fucntion without return type.

        syntax :
            def <funname>:
                block of code

2) fucntion with parameteres and fucntion without return type.

        syntax :
            def <funname>(parameters):
                block of code

3) fucntion without parameteres and fucntion with return type.

        syntax:




4) fucntion with parameteres and fucntion with return type.







=======================================================================================


* args and **kwargs :

*args = arguments (tuple as a parameter)

**kwargs = key with arguments (dictionary as a arguments)






------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lambda function = lambda is a keyword which is use to define lambda fuction  

                lambada function is a anonymous function 

                means function without any name its called lambda function

                syntax : 

                var lambda arguments : body
