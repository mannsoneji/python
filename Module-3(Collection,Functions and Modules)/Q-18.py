# What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple

# Tuple is a collection data type which is contain similar and dis-similar data elements at single location.

# it is unchangeable and immutable
# tuple can define in () round braces
#	ex., t1 = (1,2,3)


# The main Differences between list and tuple are as under

# Mutability: Lists are mutable (can be changed), while tuples are immutable (cannot be changed after creation).

# Syntax: Lists use square brackets [], whereas tuples use parentheses ().

# Performance: Tuples are generally faster than lists due to their immutability.
